# Best-Agent-prediction

The manager at our client are primarily responsible for recruiting the agents once they identified the potential applicant, they would explain their business opportunity to the agent. Once the agent provides the consent required for it, it is made to our client to become an agent. In the dataset, the feature known as application_receipt_date is present from this date on the potential agent have to undergo a 7 days training at our client's branch and clear examination to become an agent.

Our client makes a significant investment to identify, train, and recruiting this agent. However, some agents do not reach up to expectations and bring expected resultant business after recruitment. Our client wants a data scientist to help them provide insight using the data given to us and our goal is to predict whether an agent will source new business in the next 3 months which would help them identify the right agents to hire and thus make the whole process more agile.
